# Anyverse

## What is Anyverse?

[any-sync](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync) + note taking app = Anytype\
any-sync + \* = Anyverse (because star, get it? 🤓🤓🤓)

The [Any Association](https://github.com/anyproto) is free to take the name anytime without permission or credit.

## But really, what is Anyverse?

Anyverse is my temporary solution for extending the any-sync frontend while waiting for official plugin support.

It contains the following apps:

| Status | Name             | What it does                                             |
| :----: | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
